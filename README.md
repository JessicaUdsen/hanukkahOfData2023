# Hanukkah of Data 5784
These are completed exercises from [Hanukkah of Data](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/5784/). 

Hanukkah of Data (HoD) is similar to Advent of Code (AoC), but is more geared towards data science and data munging exercises (and is obviously Hanukkah themed!).
Check out the About page [here](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/about/).

This year, like with AoC, I'm using R. My specific goals:
1. Improve my R skills in general
2. Code in a way idiomatic to R
3. Learn how to write code that is efficient, without sacrificing readability
